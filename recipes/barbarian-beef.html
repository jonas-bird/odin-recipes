      <h2>Chef John's Barbarian Beef</h2>
      <p>If you've ever wanted to channel your inner barbarian and cook a large hunk of meat right on the coals, no grill needed, then this is the recipe for you -Chef John</p>
      <p>Sometimes the classic ways are best. A no nonsense way to cook beef</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) boneless top round steak, or to taste</li>
          <li>salt to taste</li>
          <li>100% natural hardwood lump charcoal. 9 out of 10 barbarians recommend the smoldering ruins of your mortal foe's castle brand (TM)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>For the Sauce</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
          <li>1 Fresno chile pepper</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons rosemary leaves</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt (if you cant get <em>the tears of the kin of your mortal foe's</em>)</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons olive oil (I like Monini)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Season both sides of beef generously with salt. Let sit at room temperature, flipping halfway through, for 30 minutes.</li>
          <li>Burn a bed of charcoal until coals are glowing red and ashy white on the surface, rearranging coals as needed.</li>
          <li>Place the beef right on top of the coals. Cook, flipping over halfway, about 4 minutes per side. Continue cooking until the internal temperature of the meat reaches 120 degrees F (49 degrees C) for medium-rare, 1 to 2 minutes more per side. Transfer beef to a plate. Let rest while making the sauce.</li>
          <li>Place garlic, chile pepper, rosemary, and kosher salt in a mortar. Crush into a paste using a pestle. Stir in vinegar and oil.</li>
          <li>Slice beef thinly and spoon the sauce on top.</li>
      </ol>
